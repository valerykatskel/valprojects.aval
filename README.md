# Short description
This is one of my first projects. It was an April of 2010... It was an IE6's time... It was full of energy and it was necessary to take into account his wishes like as PNG, max-width and more and more...
Nowadays this company and its websites are no longer alive. I deployed a backup (the latest version that I had) to show the work that I did. This is ONLY DEMO, NOT REAL SERVICE. You can see demo here: http://valprojects.net/p/aval/
